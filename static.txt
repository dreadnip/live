Speed üöÄ

As there are no back-end systems, client-server requests, or database queries involved in delivering a static website. It exhibits blazing-fast performance with its servers always ready with HTML outputs. Besides, it can include a caching feature to eliminate delays.

Security üõ°Ô∏è

With no database to exploit, no ground for unauthorized access, and no extensions or plugins to route into your system, static websites offer much more security than a dynamic website. Thus, you are safe from phishing campaigns, online snooping, malware, or any sort of data loss.

Scalability üôå

Scaling and replying to a static website is relatively much simpler, while the overall application is more stable. The server can handle huge traffic incidents due to the reduced load associated with static files.

Hosting and Affordability ‚ù§Ô∏è

Basic HTML files require fewer spaces, which makes it simpler and easy to host these websites. You can cut down costs while channeling your resources for integrating automated builds or Git to incorporate modifications in the system.
