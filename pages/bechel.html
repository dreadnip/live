Hello and welcome to our September newsletter,

Preparation for a sport is doing hard work. It can be physically hard, it can be hard to schedule, and it can be emotionally hard to work on things you’d rather not, but it all ends up hard at some point. The trap is divergence. The trap is when we convince ourselves that more of the stuff we’re good at is the solution. That doing five laps on a wired route is more useful than spending time building much needed shoulder stability. The trap is when we dive too deep into looking for optimal solutions rather than putting our heads down and doing the work.

I’ve written before about our focus on the “last” 10% of performance that is so interesting and sexy. Things like quasi-isometrics, nutrient timing, supplementation, wearing two different shoes, and the like. This is interesting stuff, and seems so much more specific to performance than going to bed by 10, drinking 3 liters of water a day, eating vegetables, and getting enough protein. Doing the Moonboard benchmarks is super entertaining, but for most of us, just bouldering, at all, a couple of days a week, for most of the year, is the big key.

The study of the sport is not the sport.

Learning about how hypertrophy works (to this day no one really knows what causes our muscles to grow) is interesting, but it doesn’t make them grow. Sorting out the science on aerobic versus anaerobic capacity and power can be confusing and exciting all at the same time, but it doesn’t change the fact that you do still need to go to the gym and train. We don’t really need to know how it works to make it work for us.

This brings us to the “black box.” As much as it is useful to try and understand what happens in the body when we are training, it’s academic. As long as we know what to do in training (input for the black box), we can expect a result on the back end (output from the black box).

I’m not saying that trying to understand the processes is a waste of time, I’m just saying that worrying too much about understanding before acting is probably taking away from some valuable training time. We don’t need to understand metabolism in order to eat. We don’t need to know the details of aerobic adaptations in order to know how to improve them. We don’t need to know how our phones process and store information in order to use them.

Most of the time, we just need to work.

Last month, we gathered all of the Climb Strong coaching team for a weekend of education and climbing. During one of the discussions, AJ Sobrilsky voiced his frustration over his athletes’ need to “feel it” each session. Unless we feel power decline, finger strength wane, or get so pumped we can’t close our hands, we must not have trained hard enough. We get the message, from friends, YouTube, and old Rocky movies, that we need to be crushed by training at all times, or it’s not training.

Sure, once in a while, your training will leave you sore, but we have to remember the goal: improved performance. If training is not producing higher levels of strength, longer intervals, or bigger links, it’s not working...no matter how sore it makes us. It’s not what happened today, but what happened this month that matters. One workout is a trauma, ten workouts are a stimulus. The trick is to give yourself the time to progress, to allow yourself to adapt, and to save your “war face” for the crag. Ten sessions of maybe not optimal exercises, and maybe leaving the gym with some fuel left in the tank. It’s not much to ask, but most of us can’t do it. Route 4x4s are a session we recommend to help climbers build low-end endurance. They are tedious and the climbing feels pretty easy. For a 5.12a climber (one who can send that grade in one session - a few tries at most), we would probably recommend starting this workout at about the 5.10a level. Clearly, this is easy for this person, but the session consists of doing one pitch of 10a, then immediately toproping it 3 times. The climber would then rest for 12-15 minutes, maybe while a partner does the same 4 laps, then repeat the whole thing three more times.

The laps feel too easy. In order to adapt properly to primarily aerobic fueling and building all-day capacity, though, they need to be easy. More times than I can count, I’ve had people try the session, increase the difficulty mid-session (to, say, 11b) get totally smashed by it and “feel” like it “worked.” Rarely have I had an athlete do this workout nine more sessions. Too tedious. It is training, not entertainment. Way before even the fifth session, most of them will have listened to another interview on The Nugget and been inspired to go another direction. Remember, getting endurance is boring, having it is not.

You can’t buy it.

One of the things I love about performance is that you can’t buy it. Sure, you can hire help, can take drugs, can build a team of therapists and dietitians, but you still have to go boulder to get better at bouldering. There’s no faking it either. Hang out at a Salt Lake City coffee shop on a Saturday morning and you’re bound to see a guy ride up in an expensive kit on a $10k road bike, and there’s no telling whether he is a pro or just rode down for coffee. Even when he’s out riding with a group of friends, it’s hard for the casual observer to tell how good this person really is. At the crag, thank the gods, there is no pretending. You have it or you don’t. Your excuses are so terribly transparent that you might as well swallow them all. You should have trained harder. Should have climbed more. It doesn’t matter how nice your gear looks. I have been thinking a lot about how people tend to think they are “doing everything right” in their training, and if, by any chance, they are not, it’s just because of ____ (insert external factor such as gym open times, demanding job, being a great family man). It’s hard to swallow that you might have just been doing it wrong, as I did when I dedicated 6 months of my life to building my power endurance back in the early 2000s. And no, it didn’t work. I wrote a book about that training. Don’t buy it. Stepping back and seeing that it didn’t work is progress. Assigning no judgement or ego to it is additional progress. Taking the information from that training phase and applying it to the next is science. Learn from yesterday’s mistakes. Fix them. Don’t fall into the same pattern. I sound like Dr. Phil, but it’s true; our habits can make or break us.  In this way, inspiration and motivation are our enemies. Yes, I want you to be motivated to train first thing every day, but I don’t want you to plan out a year that you can’t possibly execute. Where you are is where you’re starting. It’s amazing to me the number of people who will set a goal of climbing Moonlight Buttress in Zion (a climb that sports a half-dozen pitches of 5.12)  later this year, not having redpointed a half dozen 5.12s in the past year.  Good goals inspire, but the very best represent a small step forward in daily practices that add up to a “leveling up” over 4 or 6 or 12 months. Motivation will betray you when you need it most.    A practice of going just one better than last year is a solid plan. I have a spreadsheet where I track each month’s training numbers. I put down training type and time, climbing days, number of pitches and the grades of those sends. I put down average bodyweight and my testing numbers for that month. I can go back easily and look at the months with my hardest climbing ever, and then see how many climbing and training days led up to those performances. Where I was strength-wise. What my body weight was. It then becomes very easy to plan the weeks of training leading up to a trip or attempt at a limit-level send. I don’t need to do 8 pitches per day, I just need to do about what I did last time. I need to aim for similar volume and intensity, and the rest is just putting in the time on the rock. Success leaves tracks. The hardest thing I do in my own training (and in my life) is to look at what I might be doing wrong and aim to correct it. Shortcuts are attractive. I’d love a 4-week fix to a problem—any problem. I’d love to throw money at a problem and have it fixed. Maybe the best thing about climbing is that it doesn’t allow for pretending. Time to saddle up for another season of working harder than we thought we’d have to.  

Hold Fast,  Steve
