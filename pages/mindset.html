		<p>When I feel overwhelmed or stressed or lose my center, I draw on one or all of these things:</p>
		<p><b>Be kind &amp; be useful.</b></p>
		<p>Slow way, way down.</p>
		<p>Let the world speak to you.</p>
		<p>Rest your mind on your breath.</p>
		<p>I am only as good as the company I keep.</p>
		<p>How can I best support my own vulnerability?</p>
		<p>Compassion is the highest form of critical thinking.</p>
		<p>My life—which includes my work—is only as good as I feel.</p>
		<p>Try to put how you want to feel ahead of what you want to be or even do.</p>
		<p>This is what I'm doing, this thing, right now; drop the words, stick with the feeling.</p>
		<p>Be ready for opportunities &amp; openings as they come along; change is the only constant.</p>
		<p>Go toward the good—the good people, the good moments—&amp; let the rest of the static, noise &amp; drama fall away.</p>
		<p>While we're breathing—which is miraculous, and won't be happening some day—all we're doing is learning and growing. That's all, learning and growing.</p>
		<p>
		Follow your interests, wherever they lead will be somewhere that lights up your eyes, or floats your cork; notice when you get excited &amp;/or confused by things, write down these moments &amp; let them guide you.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p style="text-align: right; ">When I realize I am distracted, I ask:
		<blockquote>What is standing between me &amp; being present right now?</blockquote>
		<p>When I’m confused by someone else’s behavior:
		I try to imagine what it feels like to do or say what they’re doing or saying &amp; feel that it is good, correct, right, justified, chosen, the way I typically feel about my own choices. More often than not, we believe we’re right. Everyone makes sense to themselves. Sometimes I call this personal logic.</p>
		<p>When I’m humbled by a moment when I’m fumbling:
		I smile &amp; wave at the world and say, “This is me learning, right here &amp; right now,” &amp; to myself, gently, trying to remember to laugh while I say it, “Challenges are opportunities for growth.”</p>
		<p>When I feel myself shutting down in a stressful situation, proverbially clenching my fist:
		I imagine what it would be like to open my hand, gently, so that a feather or a bird could land on it (I know how cheesy that sounds, but I say it anyway). I dial down the seven inputs of experience (five senses, thoughts, and feelings) and tune in to the constant current of my witnessing consciousness. I notice my heart when it closes, then let the waves of feelings flow through my heart, unstuck.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The gifts my father left me:I refuse to be insulted;The trick is to be ready;
				How lucky are we to live in this beautiful place?</p>
