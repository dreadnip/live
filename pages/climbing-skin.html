    <h1>Notes on climbing skin</h1>
    <p>Some general thoughts and lessons learned about good climbing skin</p>
    <ul class="list-circle">
        <li>Always wash hands right after climbing. Water & soap.</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaphor">Aquaphor</a> seems to work well for repairing skin right after a session. It moisturizes, gets rid of redness and helps with cuts, splits and chafing. Apply liberally.</li>
        <li>Only moisturise after a session or when your skin is extremely dry. Do not use anything daily. Skin recovers best on its own.</li>
        <li>Avoid sunscreen and lotions. They soften up the skin too much, causing it to wear quickly.</li>
        <li>Don't bite your nails or the surrounding skin.</li>
        <li>Sanding with sandpaper keeps the skin even, especially on your calluses.</li>
        <li>Using a razor blade to get rid of calluses can work, but it’s very easy to go too far/deep. Nail clippers + sanding is a better option.</li>
        <li>If you can get it, sanding with a piece of sandstone works just like sandpaper and has the added benefit of keeping skin rock-ready</li>
        <li>Sand in a slow, controlled motion. Fast sanding burns the skin.</li>
        <li>Antihydral makes skin really dry/thick. Apply overnight, only to fingertips. A small dot/layer is enough.
            <ul class="list-square">
                <li>First day after applying it, skin tends to sweat less. Second day after applying sweating is reduced further and skin is also thicker. Third day skin should be noticeably harder/thicker and not sweating. After that, the effects start to go away. After 7 days effects are barely noticeable, but some people report that using it 1-2 times a month is enough to get long-lasting effects.</li>
                <li>If applying Antihydral and not climbing, sanding is mandatory.</li>
                <li>Products like Rhino Dry or Tip juice contain the same active ingredient as Antihydral, methenamine. They contain less and are far less aggressive though.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For dry skin, moisturising right before you climb can work well. Rhino Spit is a good product.</li>
        <li>Liquid chalk contains alcohol, which also dries out skin. If you have wet/soft skin, using it as a base layer can be useful.</li>
        <li>Switch between skin intensive training days and “skin rest days”. Rest day can be hangboarding, campus training, strength or power training, board climbing on wooden holds or antagonist work. Skin intensive days are projecting sessions outdoor or long gym sessions.</li>
        <li>Taping is a crutch that should be avoided. Only do it to recover a worn-out tip that has fully broken through (bleeding or close to).</li>
        <li>If you're new to the sport, don't worry. Your skin will adapt over months/years and become stronger.</li>
        <li><b>Everyone should experiment to find their own skin care routine, but a good rule of thumb is: less is more. Don’t over moisturise, don’t over-sand, don’t dry out too much. Just let your skin be.</b></li>
    </ul>
