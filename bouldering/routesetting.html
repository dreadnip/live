            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>Mark your building area. Just cones isn't enough sometimes, people will still walk through them.</p>
            <p>Timing. Is there enough room to build? How busy is the gym?</p>
            <p>Keep your gear organised!</p>
            <p>Always clean your working area before testing. Don't put on climbing shoes while there are still holds, bolts, screws, tools, etc.. on the mat.</p>
            <p>Don't life heavy loads alone. Use carts. Life with your legs.</p>
            <h3>In the problem</h3>
            <p>Downclimb routes/jugs</p>
            <p>Avoid way for the climber to get stuck (cracks/heelhooks) in case of a fall.</p>
            <p>Select appropriate holds for the level (e.g. no mono's in easy levels)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Tools</h1>
            <p>The main tool you'll use is an impact driver. Get a soft-impact one for reduced stress on your wrist and elbow + lower noise.</p>
            <p>You'll need the following bits: an 8M hex bolt bit and a T20/25 Torx screw bit</p>
            <p>While the impact driver can be used for screws, you should avoid it if you can. A drill driver will break fewer screws.</p>
            <p>Allen key (with handle)</p>
            <p>Ladder: telescopic and aluminium is the easiest to work with.</p>
            <p>Multitool is useful</p>
            <p>Pliers</p>
            <p>Lonestar ringo for free placement of holds</p>
            <p>Tap or tap bit (M10)</p>
            <p>Protective glasses, earbuds/headphones and gloves</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>Select which portion of the wall you're going to build on.</p>
            <p>Remove old holds from wall</p>
            <p>Think about what feature/line on the wall you might use.</p>
            <p>Wash holds</p>
            <p>Pre-bolt your holds and lay them out on the mat, so you can quickly iterate on ideas.</p>
            <h3>Difficulty</h3>
            <p>Think about the difficulty before you start building. After the first draft, tweak the boulder until you reach the desired grade.</p>
            <p>In most cases it's better to make your draft on the easy side of your desired grade.<p>
            <p>Set your boulder in a way that each move is at least do-able when you test it.</p>
            <p>You can make your boulder harder afterwards by removing a foothold, space out the holds, switch out holds for a worse one, etc..</p>
            <p>It's harder to make a working move easier, because if you switch to better holds, it might break another section of your boulder.</p>
            <h3>Hold selection</h3>
            <p>Avoid mixing and matching multiple sets. Pick 1-2 sets and stick to those. Footholds can be anything.</p>
            <p>Choose a theme and stick to it. Unexpected moves confuse the climber and lead to more injuries. For example don't start with 3 sloper moves, then pockets and end on crimps.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Building</h2>
            <p>Try to be efficient. Don't waste energy on actually doing moves. Work by visualising the moves and feeling the holds</p>
            <p>After you put up the first draft, test the route and start tuning. Have someone else climb the route as well and ask for feedback.</p>
            <p>Don't over-force moves. Everyone has their own style and will climb things differently.</p>
            <p>You don't have to start with the start hold. Volumes and key moves first.</p>
            <p>If a move doesn't work, try:
             replacing the hold with a better or worse one
             moving the holds slightly</p>
             <p>If both don't work, change the move</p>
            <p><strong>Take breaks!</strong> Leave the space for a while and come back. You'll get new ideas.</p>

            <h2>The Godoffe method</h2>
            <h3>Target</h3>
            <p>Who are you setting for? Difficulty</p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>What are you trying to accomplish? Training boulder (power? endurance?), competition boulder, beginner boulder (teaches technique), fun, creativity, testing new ideas/moves</p>
            <h3>Time</h3>
            <p>How long do you have for this problem? 45 minutes is a good aim</p>
            <p>Focus on putting up a fast draft of your idea. Fast shit is better than slow shit. More time for tuning and teamwork afterwards is better.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>What is your idea for this problem?</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Do they like it?</li>
                <li>Is it too height dependent?</li>
                <li>Is it good for tall people? Short people?</li>
                <li>Is it safe?</li>
                <li>Are they confused?</li>

            <h2>How to dictate styles</h2>
            <p>Large feet and small/bad handholds on a vert wall = balance</p>
            <p>Small feet and large hand holds = dynamic</p>
            <p>Dynamic moves that tall people can't skip -> jump sideways</p>
            <p>Blocking!!</p>
            <p>Wide starting position with 2 starting holds apart creates movement. Good for dynamic moves right after.</p>
            <p>1 large volumes as feet with a single starting hold can also create movement, but usually more coordination than actual distance.</p>
            <p>Opposing holds (perpendicular), forces the climber to twist. Can be static on slab, or dynamic in powerful boulders. Warning: can be awkward.</p>
            <p>Block crimps to prevent them being used as feet later on + require accuracy</p>
            <p>Combine two crimps (or chips on volumes) to create pinches.</p>
            <p>Recycle move: use a hold to go either right/left, then use it again to move up.</p>

        	<h2>General tips</h2>
            <p>Success rate = fun / energy put into building</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Aesthetic is important</li>
                <li>Don't focus on beta, instead try to set movement.</li>
                <li>Don't attach your ego to problems, listen to feedback and change quickly.</li>
                <li>Opt for a comfortable starting position over an awkward one</li>
                <li>A tricky match is better than a tricky start. You want climbers to at least start your problem.</li>

        	<h2>Beginner routes (pre-V2)</h2>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Guide the climber. Place holds where they'd expect them.</li>
                <li>Don't build complicated sequences.</li>
                <li>Make a boulder challenging by slightly forcing shoulder moves or side-pulls that force the climber to twist in their hips.</li>
                <li>Simple and clear movement is more appreciated than hard, tricky movement at this level.</li>
                <li>Try to include at least 1 core movement that the climber will learn and improve on when he completes the route.</li>

Anatomical variations in the pulley system are very common. Here is one study that took a look at thumb pulley system (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0363502312011379). The pulleys can be missing. They can be fused with other pulleys or be different sizes that thought. They can be partly fused with cruciate pulleys or not etc.

This study found 32 different patterns of pulley anatomy (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35615810/).

The classic anatomical figures of the thumb pulley anatomy include 3 pulleys. When only 11.8% of people have actually 3 pulleys. 76.7% have 4 pulleys and 5.8% 5 pulleys. (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1558944716660555fb). This could as well be the case for other fingers.
